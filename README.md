## Quick start

Install the plugin with [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io):

```bash
steampipe plugin install godaddy
```

Configure your [credentials](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/godaddy#credentials) and [config file](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/godaddy#configuration).

Configure the Organization URL and Personal Access Token in `~/.steampipe/config/godaddy.spc`:

```hcl
connection "godaddy" {
  plugin = "godaddy"

  # For setting API keys see instructions at https://developer.godaddy.com/keys
  # The API key for the GoDaddy account.
  # This can also be set via the `GODADDY_API_KEY` environment variable.
  # api_key = "hkw647irnrhttXW_TmcsFgxJQBvLjE5L1234402"

  # The secret key for the GoDaddy account.
  # This can also be set via the `GODADDY_SECRET_KEY` environment variable.
  # secret_key = "DjfrsqEB12345hdsieDShdjs"

  # The type of the environment, based on the value the endpoint will be change. Possible values are: DEV | PROD.
  # This can also be set via the `GODADDY_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE` environment variable.
  # environment_type = "DEV"
}
```

Or through environment variables:

```sh
export GODADDY_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE="DEV"
export GODADDY_API_KEY="hkw64xxxxabchttXW_TmcsFgxJQBvLjE5Lda8402"
export GODADDY_SECRET_KEY="DjfrsqEBA4vVjsdsdsdieDShdjs"
```

Run steampipe:

```shell
steampipe query
```

List your GoDaddy domains:

```sql
select
  domain,
  status,
  nameservers,
  privacy
from
  godaddy_domain;
```

```
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------+--------+---------+
| domain          | nameservers                                         | status | privacy |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------+--------+---------+
| mycloudlab.in   | ["ns21.domaincontrol.com","ns22.domaincontrol.com"] | ACTIVE | false   |
